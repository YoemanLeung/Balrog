##To make a meds file with balrogSE.py##

- First you need the data. Use Balrog/sync_tile.py (python sync_tile.py <tilename> <band> <mode>) with mode=all to get all
the required data for a given tile. This wraps some of esheldon's desdb binaries, so make sure you have 
<path-to>/desdb/desdb/bin in your $PATH. You'll also need to set the environment variables DESDATA (local root directory for DES
data), DESREMOTE (root directory DESDM), and DESPROJ (=OPS).

- Try running balrogSE.py. Required arguments are <tilename> (e.g. DES0346-5331 for a Y1 testbed tile) and an output directory.
Use the config file 'config_y1.py' (-pc <path-to>/Balrog/config_y1.py). By default it assumes you have the CMC morphology catalog 
'CMC_allband_upsample.fits' in your Balrog directory.
